Liked: I learned a ton

Challenging: I tried going off the Udacity warehouse and completed the project. Unfortunately, it crashed after hours and hours of work and would not build. I started from scratch using the most recent SteamVR and the most recent Unity (2018.3.7f1). The new app is very simple, but all the objects I modeled in Blender and I didn't have time to spice it up a lot.

This app was built and run in the most recently updated SteamVR on a Windows 10 system.

This app was created for and tested on the Oculus Rift.

I only saw the fade requirement in the rubric AFTER I prepped my project. I went back to make the correction and my project broke again and the controllers stopped working in Unity. When I prepared the project I probably deleted some needed files. I don't have time to redo it, so please allow me to move on to the next assignment.

Please let me know how much time I have left for the class. I can't afford to purchase it again.
